================= Asm-Pro V1.20 (17-Dec-2023) =======================
People contributing to this opensource release:
- amigo/binary (amigo@binary.si)

[ ADDITIONS ]
01: ASM: New symbol REPTN, value is set to 0 to (N-1) while inside a
    REPT block and -1 while outside.
02: ASM: New predefined symbol ASMPRO, value contains ASMPro version
    in the following format: major*256+minor.
03: ASM: New directive EQUA, intended for post-processing. Do not use
    if unsure how it works and what it does. It works similar to EQU
    but the value is absolute (it also "relocates" and can be used to
    access relocatable data from absolute sections).
04: ASM/DISASM: Added support for PLPA instruction (68060).

[ MODIFICATIONS ]
01. UI: reqtools.library v38+ is required instead of any version.
02. DISASM: FNOP is now displayed instead of a 0 displacement FBF.W.
03. ASM: Macro parameter \@ reimplemented to work correctly with
    system includes (pass1/2 conflicts with conditional assembly).
04: ASM: Trailing / is appended to INCDIR path if needed.
05: ASM: Current source directory is used as fallback to find include
    files, and finally the INCLUDE: assign as well.
06. ASM: Both CMP and CMPM with (Ax)+,(Ay)+ are now allowed.
07: ASM: Allow MOVEM and FMOVEM descending register lists.
08: ASM: Allow longword size for FMOVEM with control registers.
09: UI: The ancient prefs toggles and closewb code removed from the
    menu event handler.
10. Over 900 additional micro optimizations, 21KB reduction of the
    executable size compared to v1.18.

[ BUGFIXES ]
01. UI-1.19: File pattern in the read/write source file requester is
    incorrect if Source .ASM is enabled in the general preferences.
02. UI: Crash if diskfont.library couldn't be opened.
03. DISASM: Crash on 68000/010 systems if DBcc.L (Apollo) has a 2-char
    conditional code.
04. EDIT: Continuously pressing page up to reach the top of the source
    code after unsuccessful assembly (and similar variations), would
    freeze the editor.
05. DISASM: CALLM absolute and pc-relative modes don't work, immediate
    mode's hex operand is missing a leading $.
06. DISASM: Several CHK2 and CMP2 modes don't work.
07. ASM: Incorrect opcodes generated or not supported for CHK2 and CMP2.
08. DISASM: CINV and CPUSH specifier NC (neither cache) is displayed as
    BC (both caches).
09. ASM: CINV and CPUSH specifier NC (neither cache) is not implemented.
10. DISASM: MOVES destination absolute long mode doesn't work.
11. DISASM: PMOVE (68030 variant) mixes up registers TT0 and TT1.
12. ASM: FMOVEM and some FMOVE variants allow destination pc-relative
    modes.
13. UI: The changed source prompts are brought up at the end of restart
    instead of right away.
14. ASM: No CPU warning for CALLM (68020 only) if the selected CPU is
    68030 or higher.
15: ASM: INCDIR path is not reset when starting a new assembly.
16: ASM: Including a directory prints out random trash characters.
17: MONI: Scrolling left/right (alt-left/right arrow) hides the cursor.
18: ASM: PMOVE with MMUSR outputs incorrect register.
19: DBG: Debugged program's user and supervisor stacks (and corresponding
    USP/SSP registers) are switched.
20: DISASM: FMOVEM has a trailing "/" in some scenarios.
21: ASM: FMOVEM allows size .X with control registers.
22: DISASM: Infinite loop with some 68040 specific FPU opcodes.
23: ASM: Watchpoints and breakpoints are kept after switching to a
    different source.
24: Public port's name and type are not initialized.
25: ASM: PRINTV doesn't flush the print buffer properly causing the next
    line to be truncated (for example, if followed by INCLUDE or INCBIN
    the path is not printed).
26: UI: System freeze and/or crash if multiple hotkeys are pressed at the
    same time, and the first one is causing the menu strip change (for
    example, pressing amiga-AS in the editor).
27: ASM: Numerous FPU instructions with source immediate longword operand
    are generated as byte, resulting either in the out of 8-bit range error
    or incorrect opcode.
28: DISASM: FSINCOS prints only one destination FPU register.
29: DISASM: Absolute and pc-relative modes don't work with all bitfield
    instructions (68020+).
30: DISASM: CMPI pc-relative index mode (68020+) doesn't work.
31: DISASM: CAS allows several invalid and non-existing modes, absolute
    modes don't work.
32: DISASM: LPSTOP (68060) is not implemented.
33: DISASM: Typos in FPU ROM constant names (appended as a comment to the
    MOVECR instruction), probably due to the same typos in the M68K manual.
    Additionally, TAB changed to a space if Printer Dump is not enabled in
    the preferences to avoid weird characters on the screen.
34: ASM: PFLUSHR doesn't allow address register indirect mode.
35: ASM: MMU register PCSR is not recognized (PCR is checked twice instead).

================= Asm-Pro V1.19 (27-Dec-2022) =======================
People contributing to this opensource release:
- amigo/binary (amigo@binary.si)

This version runs (and is able to assemble itself!) on KS2.04+ and
68000 based systems again.

[ ADDITIONS ]

1. WX command to enable short code and data hunks (code+bss, data+boss)
WX is similar to WO (write object) but it additionally strips the trailing
zeroes from the code and data sections reducing the corresponding hunk size.
To use it properly, enable DS Clear in the assembler preferences. Software
written for KS1.x must manually clear all the bss parts (KS2+ will do that
automatically when your program is run).

2. ADDBP directive to add a breakpoint from the source code
Syntax is:
	ADDBP	<expression>
For example:
	ADDBP	Label1234
	ADDBP	$30000+idx*4
Assemble your code with AD and unconditional breakpoints will be activated
and ready to go.

3. Command line history jump by 10 lines, don't store repeated lines
Use shift-up/down to jump by 10 lines. A new line won't be added to history
if it's the same as the previous one.

4. Macro symbol parameter \<symbol> and \<$symbol> (vasm style)
Macro parameter is replaced with symbol's decimal or hexadecimal value.
This enables additional splicing of symbol values with the rest of the text.
For example:
foo	SET	123
m	MACRO
.q1	SET	\1-1			; make 2 out of 1
.q2	SET	\1+1
	lea	label\<foo>(pc),a0	; lea    label123(pc),a0
	move.l	d\<.q1>,d\<.q2>		; move.l d3,d5
.q3	SET	(.q1+.q2)*\1
	moveq	#$\<$.q3>,d0		; moveq  #$00000020,d0
	ENDM
label123:
	m	4

5. Assembly elapsed time
After a successful assembly you will see how much time it has taken.


[ MODIFICATIONS ]
These are primarily structural and source code changes. Listed first
are the ones more relevant to the end user.

1. ALIGN and CNOP changes
If DS Clear is enabled in the assembler preferences, ALIGN and CNOP will
initialize bss memory with zeroes (just like EVEN and ODD). This comes as
a requirement to support the new WX command.

2. Required stack size reduced from 32KB to 16KB

3. Command line history reduced from 256 to 128 entries
This is due to its really-not-good memory efficiency. Now that there are
fewer duplicate entries this shouldn't be noticeable.

4. Data and bss sections merged
This makes all data accessible through A4 basereg to avoid absolute
addressing and relocation as much as possible.

5. Variables moved and reordered
Almost all variables in code sections moved to bss section, reordered
some variables in bss for a better logical fit and better alignment.

6. Menu construction simplified
It now uses macros, which resulted in approx. 2000 resourced lines of code
being reduced to approx. 400.

6. Source code cosmetic changes
I was trying to keep those low for now, so it's easier to see the 
actually relevant changes:
- replaced archaic [] with () (some other assemblers don't like those)
- replaced some of the resourced labels/symbols with the originals from
  Rune's asm-one source code (or added them as comments)
- changed the scope of some labels to local for clarity

7. Micro optimizations, refactoring
Over 2600 micro optimizations, and about a dozen subroutines have been
rewritten to be much shorter and/or faster. Overall, a 15KB reduction of
the executable size.

8. Eliminated or isolated many instances of 68020+ code
Placing this here instead of listing every one under bugfixes. Plenty of
violations, e.g. BCC.L (32-bit), TST Ax, odd address accesses.
Also made a couple dozen 68020+ optimizations (under IF/ELSE), but that
is low priority and plenty more could be done.


[ BUGFIXES ]
Roy Batty, after looking at the source code:
  I've seen things you people wouldn't believe...

01. DISASM: Incorrect DBcc.L (Apollo) if the last character of destination
    label is A-F.
02. DISASM: Incorrect ftst register (prints target register, always 0/fp0)
03. CMDLINE: Internal address error while parsing a bad '\' sequence, e.g.:
    ?label\  (missing . after \).
04. ASM: PRINTT partially prints its text over assemble progress text if the
    progress indicator is enabled and text to print is short.
05. DISASM: CAS addressing modes (d16,Ax) and (d8,Ax,Rx) don't work due to
    extended opcode.
06. ASM: Missing EREM/ETEXT causes infinite loop in pass1 due to trashed
    flags. Bonus loop if All Errors is enabled in the assembler preferences.
07. ASM: Repeated assembling keeps adding duplicates of the same watchpoints
    if ADDWATCH is used in the source code.
08. ASM: Watchpoint data becomes incorrect due to a wrong increment and memory
    trashing while adding a new one.
09. ASM: CMPI doesn't allow (d8,PC,Rx) (and respective extended modes) as its
    destination effective address (68020+)
10. CMDLN: Source bookmarks are corrupt after reading a project with RE:
    - WE and RE write and read all source bookmarks (in <project>.APrj) as
      absolute addresses, and not as relative offsets from the source start.
    - Additional invalid code sequences that can cause stack corruption.
11. CMDLN: UA (update project) causes a crashes at the end, while switching
    back to the active source.
12. ASM: ADDWATCH error disables menus and Amiga key via RMB-trap. Also, if
    the error occurred at the end of the line (e.g. missing parameter), it
    will print out random trash characters.
13. ASM: ADDWATCH doesn't parse symbol names with 15+ characters properly.
14. DBG: AD command incorrectly handles the no parameter case (debugger entry
    point) by copying random data past the terminating zero.
15. DBG: Byte/word mismatch resulting in FPU registers being displayed instead
    of CPU registers, or vice versa.
16. DBG: Debugger stuck in refresh due to a mix of non-register and register
    based watchpoints (perpetual error to refresh to error...).
17. UI: Byte/word mismatch in font related code potentially causing incorrect
    font style, size, and/or flags.
18: ASM: Macro not found (Illegal operator error) in some rare cases due to
    macro being looked up as a local and not global symbol. Reordering the
    code, adding a dummy local label, or referencing an unrelated symbol for
    no reason could sometimes magically fix it.
19: CMDLINE: History stops working properly after all the entries have been
    filled up (it only replaces the last entry). Also, anti-cycling (stop at
    first/last entry) doesn't work properly due to hardcoded limits.
20. ASM: Macro parameter expansion doesn't handle semicolon comments properly,
    and it can end up in an error if some unfortunate backslash sequence of
    commented out chars is found.
21. ASM: SET directive in a REPT 0 block results in error.
22. UI: keymap.library is not closed in a way that makes exec.lbrary sad.
23. ASM: TRAPcc variant opcode without operand (no .size) followed by a
    comment results in error.
24. MONI: Switching to binary mode in monitor sometimes doesn't work due to
    internal parsing error causing it to reset back to the previous mode.
25. ASM: Index scale (in indirect addressing modes with index) parser is not
    robust, it allows *$$@$@$$@ (multiple hex/octal indicators), *@8 (invalid
    octal number).
26. ASM: FILESIZE() directive modifies the source code if path is invalid
    (temporary modification is not reversed).
27. ASM: DS.D (fp double) doesn't clear the correct amount of memory.
28. CMDLN: If Y (execute) command fails, screen flags aren't restored from
    WBENCHSCREEN back to CUSTOMSCREEN.
29. DBG: Incorrect shortcut for the Dx/FPx register swap in the menu.
30. ASM: TEXT/ETEXT '|' hexadecimal mode is not initialized, and being used
    as a toggle it means it will not only carry over between separate blocks
    but also between assembly attempts with the same or different sources.
31. ASM: TEXT/ETEXT handler doesn't skip the hexadecimal mode '|' character
    in pass1 but does in pass2, resulting in the code moved in pass2 error or
    producing incorrect code.
32. CMDLN: =A reports incorrect ASM-Pro sections (badly outdated).
33. ASM: Opcodes for PULSE and HALT (68060) are reversed.
34. DISASM: PULSE and HALT are not implemented (68060).
35. CMDLN: 1KB of chip memory is leaked if bootblock checksum fails (e.g. no
    disk, write protected).
36. UI: Previous characters in the project info dialog (=P command) are still
    printed if the new project or source filename is shorter. Also, maximum
    displayed source filename length is one character too long resulting in
    overwritten spacing.
37. EDIT: Jump to next error (Amiga+e) shortcut in editor doesn't work.
38. CMDLN: History doesn't clear the command line properly when moving up or
    down and not being at the end of the line, if the next command is shorter.
39. UI: ASM-Pro.guide is not found (file has been renamed to ASMPro.guide).
40. DBG: VBR aware code could corrupt the supervisor stack in NMI/INT7 handler
    due to non-atomic combinations and unsafe sequences of instructions.
41. UI: gadtools.library is opened twice but closed only once.
42. UI: Recent files menu causes a crash on KS2.x systems due to a KS3+ only
    feature (NM_IGNORE flag).
43. MONI: Save bin (Amiga+w) doesn't work if start and/or end address is 0.
44. MONI: Save bin end address is printed at the wrong location in status bar.
45. UI: gadtools messages are not being replied in all preferences windows,
    causing memory leaks (NULL message pointer).
46. UI: All preferences windows lock up if failed to save (e.g. ENVARC: is not
    assigned).
47. MONI: Incorrect offset table index for bin/hex/ascii dump, uses magic
    numbers to produce the correct output but crashes on 68000/010.
48. UI: Palette gadgets (syntax color preferences) cause a crash on KS2.x due
    to a different implementation of the selection indicator compared to KS3+.
49: ASM: FPU instructions with immediate integer operand (e.g. fmove.s #1,fp0)
    cause a crash if no FPU is present in the system.
50: CMDLN: FPU calculator ([ command) doesn't handle div sign correctly in some
    cases, e.g. [-1 is -1.000 (ok), [-1/1 or [1/-1 is 1.000 (positive, not ok).
51. ASM: Several bitfield (BFxxx opcodes) problems:
    - negative offset/width is allowed (while not allowing values above 31/32)
    - bad register index is allowed, e.g. D8, D;
    - width 32 (equivalent of 0) is not always allowed, e.g. if offset is in a
      data register or if offset is not a zero, it's not allowed
52. Several loader/startup problems, it's almost entirely rewritten now:
    - Crash if started from WB on KS1.x systems, also missing a reply to the WB
      startup message wouldn't.
    - Potential stack corruption if started from WB and for some reason the WB
      startup message arglist is NULL (check was done), also current directory
      isn't obtained/locked.
    - dos.library isn't closed in some cases.
    - Parent process pointer (loader) passed to child process will be invalid
      if parent exits too early.
53. CMDLN: B (jump bottom) command misses the target if source has more than
    65535 lines (dbf limitation).
54. ASM: (C)MEXIT directive doesn't preserve condition level, and a frequently
    used macro will lead to the conditional overflow error.
55. ASM: SETCPU directive reports incorrect error message if argument is wrong
    (illegal operator instead of unknown cpu type). Adjusted for PPC as well.
56. UI: Memory amount slider's text in the startup window is not refreshed
    properly on KS2.x systems (leftovers on the right side).
57. UI: Memory type radio/mx buttons in the startup window don't work on KS2.x
    systems due to incorrectly handling the selection code.
58: CMDLN: Private L@ command is outdated and not working properly, disabled
    now since =A can be used instead.
59. ASM: Error and warning line numbers above 65535 are truncated.
60: DBG: Length of the argument specified by the PS command (if Parameters is
    enabled in the environment preferences), and passed in d0 is incorrect due
    to memory trashing during assembling.
61. DBG: Status bar in the no-source mode is broken due to partially outdated
    code, disabled now since there shouldn't be one or should be empty.
62. ASM: IDNT string is not initialized and will be used even if commented out
    or after switching to a difference source that doesn't have it.

	beq.b   .longsize
	cmp     #$C042,d0
	beq     ERROR_IllegalSize
	bra     HandleMacroos

can be changed into:

checksize:
        moveq   #0,d6
        move    (a3)+,d0
        and     d4,d0
        cmp     #"@W"+$8000,d0
        beq.b   .wordsize
        cmp     #"@L"+$8000,d0
        beq.b   .longsize
        cmp     #"@B"+$8000,d0
        beq     ERROR_IllegalSize
        bra     HandleMacroos

which is a lot more readable..

================= Asm-Pro V1.16f (04-03-2000) =======================
[First OpenSource Release]

Source code of Asm-Pro is now available as OpenSource. Check out the
Website for more details (http://surf.to/asmpro)..

- Fixed autoscroll problem when screensize was bigger than the screenmode size.
- Fixed warning for pmove.l TC,xx

================= Asm-Pro V1.16e (26-12-1999) =======================
[BETA release !!]

This release could be unstable for you but works fine for me most of
the time.. If it is unstabel use v1.16d. I can not give you a newer 
version at this time as I am messing with the source structure and
other things that take more time (and less updates) but will be
significant to future development..

- Removed screen flicker while changing from Data 2 Float regs in 
  debugger window.
- The editor can now handle sources with more than 65535 lines :)
  only 5 digits will show up on screen (99999) but higher linenrs
  will be handled correctly.
  (It sometimes crashes your computer if you swap workspaces and
  debug stuff a lot so I should look at it some more)
- Automatic source backup option added to the env prefs window.
  When this option is switched on, and you make an Update (U) of your
  source, it first renames the old file on disk from "yoursourcename.s"
  to "yoursourcename.s.BACKUP" and then saves the source in the buffer
  to "yoursourcename.s"
  In the future I might add an option to the prefs where you can edit the
  backup extention, maybe even add a time/date or number extention..

================= Asm-Pro V1.16d (21-07-1999) =======================
[BETA release !!]

- Bracket syntax stuff fixed and tested with:

  jsr     ([test])
  jsr     ([test,pc])
  jsr     ([a6])	;executes right but disassembles wrong
  jsr     ([a6,d3])	;executes right but disassembles wrong

  (Please tell me if you know some more that don't work)

- Fixed small opcode syntax coloring bug..  Comments on a line with no
  opcode and preceding whitespace where colored as if they where
  opcodes :)

- IncLink added. With Inclink you can add linkobjects to the
  current section like this:

  test:
	inclink "ram:testobj.o"

  [Original code for Inclink by deftronic]
  It reads a linkobject file, Relocs it and gets the symbols.  Inclink can
  only handle 1 section per file and it is put in current section.

  These Commands Can be used to make definitions

  - xref   (external reference)  a label you want from the main file
  - xdef
  - globl
  - global
  - extern (external definition) a label you will send to main file

  Use the command write-link (WL) to save a linkfile..


================= Asm-Pro V1.16 (01-04-1999) =======================
[Public release]

- Changed openscreen stuff In Asm-Pro. When screenmode from prefs
  could not be opened a pal/ntsc screen was created.. (not very usefull
  when you have a gfx-card.. so now it opens a screenmode requester..
  (yes yes I noticed it only after I installed my BVision)
- Fixed debug error with instructions like "move.l  #-1,(a1,d1.w*4)"

- "cmp.b  #0,var(pc)" works now.
- "fmove.w #1,fp0" works too.
- Fixed move16 problems in the debugger.
- Also fixed brs.l and bra.l troubles in debugger.
- Fixed fmove.b/w in debugger.

- Changed screenmode stuff to handle more than 4 colors. Now you can
  open screens from 2 to 16 colors (code works for more than 16 colors
  but I dont want to save all of them in the prefsfile).
  (some problems with reqtools showing 2 much colors in prefs though)
- Changed fontrequester from reqtools 2 asl.
  (will remove all the reqtools stuff for future compatibility)
- Added opcode coloring in syntaxprefs.
- The ':' after a label is now also colored :).

================= Asm-Pro V1.15 (05-12-1998) ========================
[Sinterklaas release] :)
[Public release]

- Changed Write block from Amiga-w to Amiga-W.
- Amiga-w is now same as 'U'pdate (more compatible to existing software).
  and also works in the editor (but will end up in command mode will fix
  that later).
- Changed the output of an error in an include file. It now shows the correct
  include file and 3 lines of code, the middle one is highlighted and
  shows the errorline. Then the include line in the current source buffer
  is shown..

Like this:

** Undefined Symbol
In file DH1:ASMPRO/INCLUDE/replay/Player6.1.s
         11 P61_motuuli:
»        12  bra.w P61_Init
         13  ifeq CIA

  144  include replay/Player6.1.s

- Change source in commandline with Function keys implemented.
- D$0100000 works again... bit 24 was cleared iso bit 0... oops..
- Added the commandline options RN and WN.
  RN will open a filerequester for opening a (source) text file with
  no wildcards. should be usefull for editing other text files like
  the startup-sequence..
  WN will do the same for write source and will also not write the
  savemarks on top of the file..
- Recoded the syntax highlighting routine (lot faster) and now it also
  handles labels (maybe more to come).
  (if you use '*-*-*-*' it will not be colored as a comment coz you can
  also do something like this: test = *-2 and then it isn't a comment)
- Fixed bug in changing source buffers when MCP's (060) CopyMemQuick
  patch is activated.
- Masked some more chars in hexdump when 'Ascii only' option is set.
- Added -f (force) option to the AUTO directive. When this option is
  used no more requesters will popup to report you that the
  'File allready exists !! Are you sure ??'. Now it will always
  create/overwrite the file.
  The force option only has to be used once in a source like in the
  example below. It will write Start to End twice without any requesters.

        auto    -f wb ram:test\Start\End\
        auto    wb ram:test\Start\End\

Start:
        dc.b    "Asm-Pro"
End:

- Added Syntax color prefs window.
- Backwards block select will not freeze asmpro anymore. backwards
  selection is not colored anymore though (will fix that later).
- Added Line numbers in the source (by popular demand)..
- Added search option in monitor (so you can search for your
  favourite opcode from inside the monitor ;).
- jmp    ([(label).w,pc,d0.l*4]) works again... (forgot to check for
  the last ']')
- Indices with preceeding 0 do assemble now (e.g. move (a0,d0.w*04),d0)
- Fill is amiga+f, insert is Amiga+i or Amiga+v
- After assembling mem pointer will be set to begin of your program.
- Updated the Asmpro.guide file.

================== Asm-Pro V1.14 (02-09-1998) ========================
[Public release]

- All 10 source buffers have there own read/write directory buffer now
  so loading a source in buffer 1 will not change the path in buffer 0.
- Save marks are now written in ASCII so you can also read your source
  in another editor/txtviewer. The line starts with ";APS" (Asm-Pro
  savemarks)
  The old savemarks are still supported but only when reading a source
  (or includes).
- Ctrl+ESC gets you into the halfscreen editor and scrolling did not work
  propperly anymore but it does now... Halfscreen mode is usefull when
  you need to see the output of a command line option while editing your
  source. (strange nobody ever reported this 2 me).
- Fixed small bug in custom scroll check routine. when CS was selected
  and screensize was changed to something other than 640 Wide CS routine
  was still used (and not working the way it should).
- Added BinMem dump (BM) to the menu.
  (btw you did know about the h.w and m.l memdump stuff changing the
   output on screen to word or longword right?
  >m.w$1200
  00001200 FF60
  )
- Workbench screen is not locked anymore if you select WB2Front.
- Added an option to the Env prefs (Scroll Sync.) to make editor updates
  wait until next frame. This could fix a scroll problem on some Amiga's.
  leave this untoughed if scrolling/editing works fine for you as it slows
  down editor speed somewhat.
- Fixed problems with syntax error highlighting (no more enforcer hits).
- Bra.l will not allow labels in another section anymore.
- Fixed section problem when using brackets, so this works now:

start:
        jsr     ([test])
        rts

	section	another,code	;this was the bottle neck..

test:
        dc.l    go_on

go_on:  nop
	rts



================== Asm-Pro V1.13a (29-07-1998) ========================
[Public release]

- Oops little bug in mark block. Some of the text would dissapear when
  block mark does not start at the beginning of the line.. Fixed now.
  (there are still problems when marking a block backwards though)..


=================== Asm-Pro V1.13 (27-07-1998) ========================
[Public release]

- Fixed problem with BEG> END> when using addresses above $7fffffff
  (like on the BlizzardPPC)
- Cmp2.l assembled wrong fixed now.(oops..)
- After a syntax error asmpro will show you how far the parser got in the
  error line by changing the color of the part that was not parsed yet.
  So the error is right in front of the colored stuff.
  (hmm hope you got that.. anyway make some typo in the source and you'll see)
- Added PCR to the debugwindow (only shown when you have a 060) requested some
  time ago but sliped my mind as I don't have a 060 :)
- Fixed some internal 060 stuff
- BUSCR and PCR  control registers where not known by the disassembler.
- jsr ([label]) and other ([xx,xx],xx,x) stuff works now. Try the next
  source in the debugger:

start:
        lea     0,a0
        lea     test,a1
        moveq.l #1,d0
        moveq.l #0,d1
        jsr     ([test])
        jsr     ([test,a0])
        jsr     ([test,pc])
        jsr     ([test,pc],d0*4)
        jsr     ([test,a0],d0*2,2)
        jsr     ([4,a1],d0*2)
	jsr	([(test).w,pc,d0])
	;ofcoz also other instructions like
	move.w  ([12,a1],d0*2),d1	;-> d1=$00005678
	;etc
        rts

test:
        dc.l    go_on
        dc.l    go_on2
        dc.l    go_on3
	dc.l	value

go_on:  nop
go_on2: nop
go_on3: rts

value:	dc.l	$12345678

- Changed the custom scroll routine and now only works with a screen width of
  640 pixels (well it did only work with 640 screens but now a requester will appear
  telling you so and I removed some obsolete code)..
- Screen size (width and height) is back in the screenmode requester.
- If the include path + filename does not fit on the screen only the last part
  of the string will be shown so you can always see the filename.
  (also applies to incbin,inciff etc.)

Like this:

Include : "ASSEMBLER:ASMPRO/INCLUDE/dos/dos.i        " =      8977 (=$00002311 )
Include : "MBLER:ASMPRO/INCLUDE/libraries/dosextens.i" =       351 (=$0000015F )
Include : "ASSEMBLER:ASMPRO/INCLUDE/dos/dosextens.i  " =     15091 (=$00003AF3 )


=================== Asm-Pro V1.12 (07-06-1998) ========================
[Public release]

- RB <file> could crash your system when no BEG or END was given.
- R <filename> works again.
- The floating point calculator ('[') displays the results correct again.
- cmp2 (dis)assemble correct now.
- Added Custom (cpu) scroll routine to speed up scrolling in the editor.
  Check Env Prefs "Custom Scrollr." to use it.
- Added different date formats to %getdate also one for $VER (dd.mm.yy)..
- Fixed strange memory slider value from startup window in absolute mode
  only noticeable if you had more than 32mb ram.

=================== Asm-Pro V1.11 (19-04-1998) ========================
[Public release]

- Fixed Processor warn and all errors switch. They should work propperly now.
  Processor warn switch was never checked..
- Fixed the click on debug window crash system bug..
- Fixed some small things.
- Fixed scrolling the wrong way when clicking in the source and dragging
  the mouse over the menu strip.
